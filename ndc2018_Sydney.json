            "description": "It’s a familiar scenario… you’re on the train, your phone goes ‘ping’, you take it out of your pocket and hey — someone sent you a message! Awww... it’s a picture of a cat doing something funny. You send back \"LOL\", you put your phone back in your pocket… but have you ever stopped to think about what’s actually involved in making that happen? Inside even the most basic smartphone there are literally hundreds of innovations, algorithms and inventions — but how do they really work? How were they developed? And what’s the next generation of algorithms and applications going to look like? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll take a deep dive into the technology behind those everyday experiences, and demystify the algorithms and abstractions that make our digital world go round. We’ll talk about cellular data networks, signal processing, the fundamental principles of filesystem design, compression algorithms, and even a bit of quantum physics. Whether you’re a programmer, a product owner or just somebody who loves using the latest tech, after watching this talk you’ll never look at your phone quite the same way again. ",

You’ll see many of the common attacks organisations are falling victim to today, how our attitudes towards passwords are changing, how to get responsible disclosure right (both as an individual and an organisation) and get a look inside some of the more modern security defences out browsers offer us today.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a mix of real world events, practical coding and face-palmingly painful security examples.",

What new structures, patterns, and policies will need to be introduced in this style of architecture? How will we deal with common business functionality, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures, and dive into the patterns, tools, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems, from desktop, SPA, and normal MVC applications. Finally, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.",

I spend a lot of my day selling DevOps. I sell strategy and culture. I sell proposals and reports. I sell benefits. And I try to convince execs to make choices and spend money. So how do you sell something that can’t be bought?\r\n\r\nMy name is Vanessa and I have DevOps in my job title. I work for a large government department that has a very low maturity in DevOps, for tools, culture and practice. In this talk I will discuss why jobs like mine are important, the kind of work we do, and why we should be utilized by the Developers in the org that are thirsty for DevOps. Just maybe I will convince you why there is room in the world for people with a job in DevOps and why you should reach out to those already in your organisation.\r\n",

High-efficiency solar panels and battery systems allow it to operate completely self-sustained, capable of nautical journeys of indefinite length. Its in-built camera allows it to Tweet photographs directly from the robot, overlaying telemetry and map data. Nyx’s long term challenge is to self-navigate from Melbourne, Australia to the coast of Antartica, a distance of 3190 kilometres. Of course this robot wasn’t manufactured by a large corporation, or even a small one. Its simply a side project a 9 to 5 software developer. Using off the shelf parts, some zip ties and a little duct tape, this presentation will show you how anyone can get involved in the world of robotics and the Internet of things.",

            "description": "Sharing: What's in it for me!? - Glenn Sarti\r\n\r\nSharing. It’s one of the four pillars of CAMS. We consume so much shared content but have we ever thought about sharing from the point of view of the Sharer? Why should I share? If I’m constantly sharing information what do I get out of it? What’s in it for me!?\r\nThis lightning talk looks at sharing through the eyes of a Sharer. What benefits do they receive out of sharing? What cultural or psychological benefits are there?\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can teach an old dog new tricks - Stephen Carter\r\n\r\nWorking in Information Technology and getting older brings it's challenges, but doesn't mean you have to be a technical archaeologist digging through sediments of Cobol or Fortran. In this session, Stephen will share stories of how he turned his career from traditional development, to one of working with cutting edge technologies and how to stay relevant in the fast-paced world of information technology.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nEstimates - how long is a piece of string... - Klee Thomas\r\n\r\nEstimates are difficult for all parties involved. Too many missed deadlines have caused business’ to mistrust them. Being told that estimates are too high and to come back with a lower number only to have the estimate treated as a commitment, or being held to estimates done months before by other developers only to have no idea what considerations went into crafting the estimate has lead to development teams dreading them. This is symptomatic of a breakdown in communication that leaves an aftertaste of resentment in the mouths of both parties.\r\n\r\nFor some the answer has been to throw out estimates out the window. This doesn’t address the lack of collaboration between the teams and stakeholders and leaves developers out of discussions about what is achievable by their team.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show how development teams can leverage the trivariate estimation technique to provide more accurate estimates and facilitate meaningful communication with business stakeholders, project and developer managers. This meaningful conversation can lead to lower estimates and development costs without cutting features or quality.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nServerless: Myths & Legends - Fabien Ruffin\r\n\r\nWhen serverless first came about, it was bound to be the solution to all our problems. Never would we have to worry about those pesky servers, deal with setup, maintenance, scaling and capacity planning. All Code, No Ops. We should \"serverless\" all the things!!! \r\n\r\nOr should we?\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will debunk all the myths and legends about serverless, on a journey to find out what serverless is really good for and where it should be avoided.",

When OSS breaks, or we need a new features, we log an issue on gitHub and then sit back awaiting a response. After a week of waiting we start complaining about how badly the project is run. The thing about OSS that's too often forgetten, it's AS-IS, no exceptions. Different projects may operate differently, with more or less people, with work being prioritised differently, on differing release schedules but in all cases the software delivered is as-is, meaning that there is absolutely no SLA. In this talk we'll look at a day in the life of an OSS maintainer: what drives them, what annoys them and what keeps them up at night.

We'll see how ASP.NET Core lights up when deployed to Microsoft Azure with logging and Application Insights, dependency tracking and timing information. We'll also explore the ways you can deploy ASP.NET Core using Git to Azure App Service, Docker and containers, or CI/CD from GitHub or VSTS.",

Awww... it’s a picture of a cat doing something funny. You send back \"LOL\", you put your phone back in your pocket… but have you ever stopped to think about what’s actually involved in making that happen? Inside even the most basic smartphone there are literally hundreds of innovations, algorithms and inventions — but how do they really work? How were they developed? And what’s the next generation of algorithms and applications going to look like? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll take a deep dive into the technology behind those everyday experiences, and demystify the algorithms and abstractions that make our digital world go round. We’ll talk about cellular data networks, signal processing, the fundamental principles of filesystem design, compression algorithms, and even a bit of quantum physics. Whether you’re a programmer, a product owner or just somebody who loves using the latest tech, after watching this talk you’ll never look at your phone quite the same way again. ",

You’ll see many of the common attacks organisations are falling victim to today, how our attitudes towards passwords are changing, how to get responsible disclosure right (both as an individual and an organisation) and get a look inside some of the more modern security defences out browsers offer us today.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a mix of real world events, practical coding and face-palmingly painful security examples.",

This talk aims to be a primer of neural networks; including the inspiration and intuition behind the concept, and the knowledge and tools one can acquire to start learning and experimenting.\r\n\r\nAs members of the technology industry, we are often bombarded with new jargon, new buzzwords, and new concepts from news and developments around the world. Artificial intelligence(AI), machine learning(ML), and neural networks(NN) all fall into that category of buzz words. This talk dives into the concept of neural networks. Neural networks are known as something used in machine learning, but few people understand how they work and the potential power of them. This talk includes how neural networks fit into AI, the historic inspiration, the intuition for how neural networks operate, the mathematical knowledge required for working with neural networks, the use cases for neural networks, and programming tools and frameworks that can assist one in developing machine learning applications using neural networks.

Nyx’s long term challenge is to self-navigate from Melbourne, Australia to the coast of Antartica, a distance of 3190 kilometres. Of course this robot wasn’t manufactured by a large corporation, or even a small one. Its simply a side project a 9 to 5 software developer.

              "description": "As software developers we often make use of open-source software (OSS) but do we ever think about all the man hours that go into developing and supporting the project. When OSS breaks, or we need a new features, we log an issue on gitHub and then sit back awaiting a response. After a week of waiting we start complaining about how badly the project is run. The thing about OSS that's too often forgetten, it's AS-IS, no exceptions. Different projects may operate differently, with more or less people, with work being prioritised differently, on differing release schedules but in all cases the software delivered is as-is, meaning that there is absolutely no SLA. In this talk we'll look at a day in the life of an OSS maintainer: what drives them, what annoys them and what keeps them up at night. Maintainers aren't jerks, they just care about the project more than you do.",

What new structures, patterns, and policies will need to be introduced in this style of architecture? How will we deal with common business functionality, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures, and dive into the patterns, tools, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems, from desktop, SPA, and normal MVC applications. Finally, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.",

We consume so much shared content but have we ever thought about sharing from the point of view of the Sharer? Why should I share? If I’m constantly sharing information what do I get out of it? What’s in it for me!?\r\nThis lightning talk looks at sharing through the eyes of a Sharer. What benefits do they receive out of sharing? What cultural or psychological benefits are there?\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can teach an old dog new tricks - Stephen Carter\r\n\r\nWorking in Information Technology and getting older brings it's challenges, but doesn't mean you have to be a technical archaeologist digging through sediments of Cobol or Fortran. In this session, Stephen will share stories of how he turned his career from traditional development, to one of working with cutting edge technologies and how to stay relevant in the fast-paced world of information technology.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nEstimates - how long is a piece of string... - Klee Thomas\r\n\r\nEstimates are difficult for all parties involved. Too many missed deadlines have caused business’ to mistrust them. Being told that estimates are too high and to come back with a lower number only to have the estimate treated as a commitment, or being held to estimates done months before by other developers only to have no idea what considerations went into crafting the estimate has lead to development teams dreading them. This is symptomatic of a breakdown in communication that leaves an aftertaste of resentment in the mouths of both parties.\r\n\r\nFor some the answer has been to throw out estimates out the window. This doesn’t address the lack of collaboration between the teams and stakeholders and leaves developers out of discussions about what is achievable by their team.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show how development teams can leverage the trivariate estimation technique to provide more accurate estimates and facilitate meaningful communication with business stakeholders, project and developer managers. This meaningful conversation can lead to lower estimates and development costs without cutting features or quality.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nServerless: Myths & Legends - Fabien Ruffin\r\n\r\nWhen serverless first came about, it was bound to be the solution to all our problems. Never would we have to worry about those pesky servers, deal with setup, maintenance, scaling and capacity planning. All Code, No Ops. We should \"serverless\" all the things!!! \r\n\r\nOr should we?\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will debunk all the myths and legends about serverless, on a journey to find out what serverless is really good for and where it should be avoided.",

I spend a lot of my day selling DevOps. I sell strategy and culture. I sell proposals and reports. I sell benefits. And I try to convince execs to make choices and spend money. So how do you sell something that can’t be bought?\r\n\r\nMy name is Vanessa and I have DevOps in my job title. I work for a large government department that has a very low maturity in DevOps, for tools, culture and practice. In this talk I will discuss why jobs like mine are important, the kind of work we do, and why we should be utilized by the Developers in the org that are thirsty for DevOps. Just maybe I will convince you why there is room in the world for people with a job in DevOps and why you should reach out to those already in your organisation.\r\n",

There is some news in the world of “infrastructure as code” that we need to consider while setting up our Cloud environments. The Win we get from being able to deploy our development environment or our temporary load test environment automatically and identically to our production environment cannot be understated.

            "description": "A key benefit to a microservices architecture is the ability to develop, test and deploy in isolation to other services. It seems paradoxical then, that for us, microservices slowed our software testing down. Instead of taking 3 days to test it was now stretching into 4 weeks. Factors such as uncertainty around boundaries, changing API contracts, configuration nightmares and scaling test environments all played a part. But that only told part of the story.\r\n\r\nTo test microservices we needed a different mentality, a different way of thinking. One that was founded within the context in which we were working. Part of the answer was to apply critical thinking to the problem, asking; \"what are the desired outcomes of testing?” and \"where is the greatest risk?\"\r\n\r\nWe avoided the assumption that more testing equals better. After all, every test has a cost, and we wanted tests that offer the most value. But we didn't do this alone. In fact, it could be argued that the biggest benefit of microservices has been to increase collaboration between testers and developers.\r\n\r\nThis talk bases itself on a case study on a fintech who ventured down the microservices path and how a testing strategy was developed throughout the rapid growth of microservices. It describes the challenges encountered, the strategies we developed and lessons learned.\r\n\r\nJoin me for a 'warts and all' talk about testing microservices and pick up some lessons learned that perhaps will help you avoid some of the traps we fell into.",

This makes it easy to mistake language implementation for a specialist area, when in fact, parsers for even very complex languages can be built in plain C# using just a few simple patterns.\r\n\r\nCome along to this session to level-up your language implementation skills.

            "description": "With Windows 10 supporting an unprecedented number of platforms and form factors (from IOT to phones to tablets to laptops and desktops to XBOX and SurfaceHub, and even the new HoloGraphic computer HoloLens), the name \"Windows 10 Universal application\" is fairly accurate. But to be honest, shouldn't a truly Universal application run on Windows 7, iOS and Android devices too?\r\n\r\nThankfully, this is possible thanks to a clever architecture pattern named Model-View-ViewModel, the .NET portable class libraries and the Xamarin frameworks. With these tools, we can structure an application so that most of the code is shared across all the platforms, and then build truly native UI that adapts without any compromises to the device it runs on. In this session, we will understand exactly how such universal applications are built. Laurent Bugnion, a XAML/C# expert, former Microsoft and Xamarin MVP who started making universal applications before it was even a thing, will show you practical knowledge with a lot of demos. Come listen from the creator of the popular MVVM Light Toolkit how this powerful but simple library can be leveraged to help you target more users than you ever dreamed of!\r\n",

            "description": "Take the data-first programming perspective further by exploring APIs, services and documents with self-generating .dll assemblies and Intellisense (a.k.a. the TypeProvider framework). We're not talking run-of-the-mill code-gen, but of a lazy way to completely resolve references to inferred structures and schema-based namespaces, giving your IDE+REPL the type-safe scaffolding and real-time magic required, so that your team can more rapidly solve business needs, using new data sources and services. Perhaps a pointed at schema is a rapidly changing work in progress, but you'd still like to derive value out of it, or you'd just like to reduce some discovery based friction -- there are a range of interesting applications.\r\n\r\nWe'll dig into the Type Provider approach and implementation,  why it's a more robust way forward than using Roselyn for this class of problem, and how to get productive building your own Type Provider. Assuming that C# eventually gets a Type Provider feature, we'll go into why you might want to consider a multi-paradigm, functional-first language like F#, to express this kind of logic anyway, especially, if the work is available readily available to C# consumers, too, as F# is a first-class CLR language -- so it's just a matter of referencing a library via standard CLR interop. We'll cover some of what it means to be good CLR .NET citizen in this session, too.  You might even go as far to say that Type Providers are a well-defined interface for introducing the benefits of functional programming to an established OO team. \r\n\r\nType Providers are cross-platform, and usable on Windows, Linux, and OSX through legacy, .NET Core, and .NET Standard.\r\n\r\nINTERESTING APPLICATION: Data Lakes with schema-on-read and schema-on-write. i.e. what happens if structure permutations during ingest fare infinite? Reducing friction make a lot of sense in this cases like these. note: the schema can change in real-time.\r\n\r\n* where anything includes, but is not limited to, the Interwebs, the IOTs, and the internet-of-internets.",

We need to create our own “framework” by picking from the plethora of libraries in the React solar system. But which ones should we choose? Or better yet, which ones do we actually need? Do we need a Flux implementation? What about handling ES6+, bundling and routing? How does it all come together?!1?!\r\n\r\nLet’s walk through the tools and helper libraries that surround React. You’ll get the most out of the session with familiarity with React and its concepts, but you don’t need to be an expert. By the end of the session, you’ll have a solid understanding of the ecosystem, know which libraries you should prioritize learning first, and confidently build your own React-based stack.",

To implement Plexop we had very limited resources and a very short time to market. That’s why we embraced Domain-Driven Design from day one, and boy did it pay out. I will show how DDD allowed us to manage complexities, talk on different strategies for defining context boundaries that we’ve used, and of course, the things that we have learned the hard way - by making our own mistakes.",

Where Git has commits, blockchain has blocks. Git uses SHA, and so does blockchain. Discover how blockchain technology actually works by building a blockchain using Git. Along the way, you'll discover features such as:\r\n\r\n\t• Wallets\r\n\t• Proof of work\r\n\t• Mining\r\n\t• 51% attack\r\n\r\nBy the end of this demonstration, you will know how blockchain solves the zero-trust problem. You will clearly see its limitations. And you will discover what you are sacrificing for that solution.\r\n\r\nLearn several patterns that you could use to solve the problems you really have.

Because of this, the performance of the website or web applications has never been more important.\r\n\r\nJoin me in this talk and we will go through what I do to speed up the applications I work on, why I do it, and the tools I use to optimise front-end performance. We will look at minimising requests, using resource compression, page rendering and some other techniques which are crucial to consider for fine tuning your applications’ performance.\r\n\r\nIt is going to be fun and I am sure you would take home some tips and tricks to keep you busy for a while, and once applied, you start hearing some wows and awesome feedback.\r\n",

That is why often times it doesn't make clear sense to developers and technologists.\r\n\r\nThis lightning talk will cover the speaker's journey on why Blockchain as a concept doesn't make sense at the beginning. He will then share his experience along the sleepless nights of asking \"Why Blockchain?\" and came up with some good answers.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAsk Alexa: How Developers Can Design Engaging Conversations with Voice - Azi Farjad\r\n\r\nJoin Azi Farjad, Developer Evangelist for Amazon Alexa, as she provides insights on how voice experiences have transformed the way that customers interact with the world around them. This poses a unique challenge for developers to understand design patterns in voice space and to build engaging conversations. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we look at the experience as a whole and take you through key learnings that you can use when building for voice with Alexa skills. We provide tips of how to create engaging voice experiences for users and will familiarize you with design patterns in voice space. We will also share how to implement the experience with Alexa.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nBuild your own GraphQL server in 10 minutes - Ben Teese\r\n\r\nGraphQL and its associated frontend libraries like Relay and Apollo Client are now reasonably well known in the industry. However, GraphQL backends are a little less well understood. Whilst there are backend-as-a-service platforms available for applications that are entirely green-field, for the rest of us it’s more than likely that, in order to accomodate all of the intricacies of our business domain and infrastructure, we’ll have to build a GraphQL backend ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I’ll show how it's surprisingly easy to get a basic GraphQL backend up-and-running in 10 minutes. Using the Apollo Server framework as a foundation, I’ll build a backend from scratch to service an existing client. Along the way I’ll introduce the concept of GraphQL resolvers and show how you write them, nest and pass data between them, and support both queries and mutations.\r\n\r\nHaving got the basics up and running, I’ll then talk about what next steps would be for security and performance, and, for those with an aversion to JavaScript, what server frameworks are available for other languages.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave this presentation with an understanding of the key concepts when building a GraphQL server, and an appreciation of just how easy it can be to get started.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nBuilding Single Page Applications with ASP.NET Core 2.1 - Jason Taylor\r\n\r\nThis lightning talk will teach you how to get started building Single Page Applications with React or Angular and ASP.NET Core 2.1. This talk will cover the basics, ensuring that you have a seamless experience from development to production.",

Is there a way to reduce the feedback loop and develop performance and stable application? Yes, yes there is Flutter. \r\n\r\nIn Google own words \"Flutter is Google’s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.\" \r\n- https://flutter.io/\r\n\r\nIn this talk will see how we will see how to use flutter, to prove how fast it can be to create an app we will build an app in less than 45min. I'm not talking about another Hello word. I mean a real application that you might find in the app store, with everything from user management,  a database, data syncing, and user-to-user communication.",

            "description": "Microservices and containers have transformed application design and deployment patterns. Modern cloud native architectures - which underpin many of the world's groundbreaking tech companies such as Uber, Netflix and Airbnb - afford unparalleled levels of agility and scale but are not without trade-offs. In applications comprising hundreds of services (and thousands of service instances), concerns such as security, operability and observability pose significant challenges. Supporting compensating capabilities such as circuit breakers, retry policies and service discovery in each microservice adds undesirable code bloat and impacts our ability to choose the best language for the problem at hand should the required libraries not be available. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will take an in-depth look at the service mesh pattern; the benefits that a decentralized microservice management approach brings; the best practices that have evolved; and most importantly what you need to know to effectively leverage a service mesh in your architecture:\r\n\r\n- How to determine the suitability of a service mesh for your application context. Don't just drink the cloud native Kool-Aid!\r\n- Disambiguate the overlapping responsibilities of an API gateway and service mesh in a modern architecture and demonstrate how they can be used in harmony.\r\n- How a service mesh enables choosing the best tool or language for a given service without being constrained by the availability of libraries for each platform. Effectively it's a weight loss plan for your microservices.\r\n- What techniques to apply when transitioning to a service mesh based architecture.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will take a hands-on look at what is involved to build and manage a microservice architecture leveraging Kubernetes and Istio, a leading open source service mesh. By the end of the session, you will not only understand the concepts underpinning the service mesh pattern but also have the knowledge to put them into practice.",

This doesn’t include those who suffer in silence without seeking help. Between long hours of solitary work and high pressure, often high-conflict team environments our field puts extra strain on our mental health. How can we care for ourselves and move beyond just ‘getting by’ to truly thrive in the workplace? This talk will share steps you can take both as an individual and as a company to help support your own and other’s mental health at work. Just as we learned to recognize the warnings and errors in our IDEs, we can learn the signs of mental illness and we can help. We will also discuss proactive steps to promote a safe, healthy work environment and address common issues before they start. We spend a lot of time talking about how we can prepare our code to be a good environment for future developers. Let’s give the same care to how we can support each other’s well-being outside the codebase.",

              "description": "A key benefit to a microservices architecture is the ability to develop, test and deploy in isolation to other services. It seems paradoxical then, that for us, microservices slowed our software testing down. Instead of taking 3 days to test it was now stretching into 4 weeks. Factors such as uncertainty around boundaries, changing API contracts, configuration nightmares and scaling test environments all played a part. But that only told part of the story.\r\n\r\nTo test microservices we needed a different mentality, a different way of thinking. One that was founded within the context in which we were working. Part of the answer was to apply critical thinking to the problem, asking; \"what are the desired outcomes of testing?” and \"where is the greatest risk?\"\r\n\r\nWe avoided the assumption that more testing equals better. After all, every test has a cost, and we wanted tests that offer the most value. But we didn't do this alone. In fact, it could be argued that the biggest benefit of microservices has been to increase collaboration between testers and developers.\r\n\r\nThis talk bases itself on a case study on a fintech who ventured down the microservices path and how a testing strategy was developed throughout the rapid growth of microservices. It describes the challenges encountered, the strategies we developed and lessons learned.\r\n\r\nJoin me for a 'warts and all' talk about testing microservices and pick up some lessons learned that perhaps will help you avoid some of the traps we fell into.",

With .NET Core, we can build Cloud Native applications that take advantage of the amazing new ecosystem that has grown around this new paradigm.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I’ll explain what all that means, why you’ll want to do it, and how to get started with .NET Core, including a look at the current state of technology and tools that support cloud native computing.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be given using DeckHub, an open source Cloud Native application that I've built as an example. It consists of multiple microservices working together to present a single site, with realtime slide-sharing, note-taking and question-asking. And we'll dig into the code, development processes, configuration, deployment and monitoring that goes into building and maintaining it.",

Whether an entire framework, a focused toolkit, or a simple custom component from GitHub, npm, or NuGet, the opportunity to improve our development speed while learning new things from open source projects is enticing.\r\n\r\nBut what does “open source” truly mean? What are our rights and limitations as open source consumers to use, modify, and redistribute these tools in a professional environment? The answer depends upon the OSS author's own decisions regarding project licensing. Come investigate the core principles of open source development and consumption while comparing and contrasting some of the more popular licenses in use today. Learn to make better decisions for your organization by becoming informed of how best to leverage the open source works of others and also how to properly license your own.",

Do we need a Flux implementation? What about handling ES6+, bundling and routing? How does it all come together?!1?!\r\n\r\nLet’s walk through the tools and helper libraries that surround React. You’ll get the most out of the session with familiarity with React and its concepts, but you don’t need to be an expert.

Build a solution in Git that keeps things fair without trust.\r\n\r\nThe solution: blockchain!\r\n\r\nIn Git, it's a shared repository; in blockchain, a distributed ledger. Where Git has commits, blockchain has blocks. Git uses SHA, and so does blockchain. Discover how blockchain technology actually works by building a blockchain using Git. Along the way, you'll discover features such as:\r\n\r\n\t• Wallets\r\n\t• Proof of work\r\n\t• Mining\r\n\t• 51% attack\r\n\r\nBy the end of this demonstration, you will know how blockchain solves the zero-trust problem. You will clearly see its limitations. And you will discover what you are sacrificing for that solution.\r\n\r\nLearn several patterns that you could use to solve the problems you really have. But the problems that blockchain solves best, you don't have. That's why you don't need a blockchain.\r\n\r\nBut if you really do, here's how they work.",

              "description": "Take the data-first programming perspective further by exploring APIs, services and documents with self-generating .dll assemblies and Intellisense (a.k.a. the TypeProvider framework). We're not talking run-of-the-mill code-gen, but of a lazy way to completely resolve references to inferred structures and schema-based namespaces, giving your IDE+REPL the type-safe scaffolding and real-time magic required, so that your team can more rapidly solve business needs, using new data sources and services. Perhaps a pointed at schema is a rapidly changing work in progress, but you'd still like to derive value out of it, or you'd just like to reduce some discovery based friction -- there are a range of interesting applications.\r\n\r\nWe'll dig into the Type Provider approach and implementation,  why it's a more robust way forward than using Roselyn for this class of problem, and how to get productive building your own Type Provider. Assuming that C# eventually gets a Type Provider feature, we'll go into why you might want to consider a multi-paradigm, functional-first language like F#, to express this kind of logic anyway, especially, if the work is available readily available to C# consumers, too, as F# is a first-class CLR language -- so it's just a matter of referencing a library via standard CLR interop. We'll cover some of what it means to be good CLR .NET citizen in this session, too.  You might even go as far to say that Type Providers are a well-defined interface for introducing the benefits of functional programming to an established OO team. \r\n\r\nType Providers are cross-platform, and usable on Windows, Linux, and OSX through legacy, .NET Core, and .NET Standard.\r\n\r\nINTERESTING APPLICATION: Data Lakes with schema-on-read and schema-on-write. i.e. what happens if structure permutations during ingest fare infinite? Reducing friction make a lot of sense in this cases like these. note: the schema can change in real-time.\r\n\r\n* where anything includes, but is not limited to, the Interwebs, the IOTs, and the internet-of-internets.",

That is why often times it doesn't make clear sense to developers and technologists.\r\n\r\nThis lightning talk will cover the speaker's journey on why Blockchain as a concept doesn't make sense at the beginning. He will then share his experience along the sleepless nights of asking \"Why Blockchain?\" and came up with some good answers.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAsk Alexa: How Developers Can Design Engaging Conversations with Voice - Azi Farjad\r\n\r\nJoin Azi Farjad, Developer Evangelist for Amazon Alexa, as she provides insights on how voice experiences have transformed the way that customers interact with the world around them. This poses a unique challenge for developers to understand design patterns in voice space and to build engaging conversations. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we look at the experience as a whole and take you through key learnings that you can use when building for voice with Alexa skills. We provide tips of how to create engaging voice experiences for users and will familiarize you with design patterns in voice space. We will also share how to implement the experience with Alexa.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nBuild your own GraphQL server in 10 minutes - Ben Teese\r\n\r\nGraphQL and its associated frontend libraries like Relay and Apollo Client are now reasonably well known in the industry. However, GraphQL backends are a little less well understood. Whilst there are backend-as-a-service platforms available for applications that are entirely green-field, for the rest of us it’s more than likely that, in order to accomodate all of the intricacies of our business domain and infrastructure, we’ll have to build a GraphQL backend ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I’ll show how it's surprisingly easy to get a basic GraphQL backend up-and-running in 10 minutes. Using the Apollo Server framework as a foundation, I’ll build a backend from scratch to service an existing client. Along the way I’ll introduce the concept of GraphQL resolvers and show how you write them, nest and pass data between them, and support both queries and mutations.\r\n\r\nHaving got the basics up and running, I’ll then talk about what next steps would be for security and performance, and, for those with an aversion to JavaScript, what server frameworks are available for other languages.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave this presentation with an understanding of the key concepts when building a GraphQL server, and an appreciation of just how easy it can be to get started.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nBuilding Single Page Applications with ASP.NET Core 2.1 - Jason Taylor\r\n\r\nThis lightning talk will teach you how to get started building Single Page Applications with React or Angular and ASP.NET Core 2.1.

A small domain-specific language can sometimes be much more succinct and expressive than a method-driven API. Parsing and language implementation belong in the toolbox of every working programmer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first time most of us encounter parser construction, it's in an academic setting that surveys the entire sophisticated and rather daunting field. This makes it easy to mistake language implementation for a specialist area, when in fact, parsers for even very complex languages can be built in plain C# using just a few simple patterns.\r\n\r\nCome along to this session to level-up your language implementation skills. We'll distill the nature of the task, the essential techniques on hand, and build a parser using tools you can introduce into your real-world applications and libraries.",

As a result, many of the assumptions and architectural decisions that Git has made have been focused on repositories that look like the Linux kernel source tree.  As a result, Git has problems at enterprise scale, and struggles to operate on source trees that have very large files, have many people working in it, or have an immense number of files.\r\n\r\nEdward Thomson will break down solutions to each of these problems, based on his experience as a software engineer working on GitHub and Visual Studio Team Services.  He'll introduce techniques to include large binaries in your repository, at ways that Git hosting providers scale to handle many simultaneous users, and scaling Git to handle the largest codebases in the world.",

Plexop is a large-scale marketing system that spans over a dozen of different business domains - from management of advertising spaces to sales agents’ commissions. To implement Plexop we had very limited resources and a very short time to market. That’s why we embraced Domain-Driven Design from day one, and boy did it pay out. I will show how DDD allowed us to manage complexities, talk on different strategies for defining context boundaries that we’ve used, and of course, the things that we have learned the hard way - by making our own mistakes.",

But to be honest, shouldn't a truly Universal application run on Windows 7, iOS and Android devices too?\r\n\r\nThankfully, this is possible thanks to a clever architecture pattern named Model-View-ViewModel, the .NET portable class libraries and the Xamarin frameworks. With these tools, we can structure an application so that most of the code is shared across all the platforms, and then build truly native UI that adapts without any compromises to the device it runs on. In this session, we will understand exactly how such universal applications are built. Laurent Bugnion, a XAML/C# expert, former Microsoft and Xamarin MVP who started making universal applications before it was even a thing, will show you practical knowledge with a lot of demos. Come listen from the creator of the popular MVVM Light Toolkit how this powerful but simple library can be leveraged to help you target more users than you ever dreamed of!\r\n",

              "description": "Microservices and containers have transformed application design and deployment patterns. Modern cloud native architectures - which underpin many of the world's groundbreaking tech companies such as Uber, Netflix and Airbnb - afford unparalleled levels of agility and scale but are not without trade-offs. In applications comprising hundreds of services (and thousands of service instances), concerns such as security, operability and observability pose significant challenges. Supporting compensating capabilities such as circuit breakers, retry policies and service discovery in each microservice adds undesirable code bloat and impacts our ability to choose the best language for the problem at hand should the required libraries not be available. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will take an in-depth look at the service mesh pattern; the benefits that a decentralized microservice management approach brings; the best practices that have evolved; and most importantly what you need to know to effectively leverage a service mesh in your architecture:\r\n\r\n- How to determine the suitability of a service mesh for your application context. Don't just drink the cloud native Kool-Aid!\r\n- Disambiguate the overlapping responsibilities of an API gateway and service mesh in a modern architecture and demonstrate how they can be used in harmony.\r\n- How a service mesh enables choosing the best tool or language for a given service without being constrained by the availability of libraries for each platform. Effectively it's a weight loss plan for your microservices.\r\n- What techniques to apply when transitioning to a service mesh based architecture.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will take a hands-on look at what is involved to build and manage a microservice architecture leveraging Kubernetes and Istio, a leading open source service mesh. By the end of the session, you will not only understand the concepts underpinning the service mesh pattern but also have the knowledge to put them into practice.",

Between long hours of solitary work and high pressure, often high-conflict team environments our field puts extra strain on our mental health. How can we care for ourselves and move beyond just ‘getting by’ to truly thrive in the workplace? This talk will share steps you can take both as an individual and as a company to help support your own and other’s mental health at work. Just as we learned to recognize the warnings and errors in our IDEs, we can learn the signs of mental illness and we can help. We will also discuss proactive steps to promote a safe, healthy work environment and address common issues before they start. We spend a lot of time talking about how we can prepare our code to be a good environment for future developers. Let’s give the same care to how we can support each other’s well-being outside the codebase.",

In this talk we take a look at the best way to protect your API using Identity Server 4 and walk through all the configuration you'll need to get third party devs up and running in no time.\r\n\r\nSpecifically we'll cover:\r\n- API first development and designing your API with third party developers in mind\r\n- Setting up Identity Server 4 with a basic real-world configuration\r\n- Protecting our API using JWTs and Bearer Authentication\r\n- Controlling access to API endpoints based on authentication policies",

            "description": "The story of the web is a story about freedom. It's a story about information, about breaking down barriers, about creating new ways for people to communicate, to collaborate, and to share their ideas. It’s also a story that has as much do with marketing, money and meetings as it does with research and innovation. It’s a story of mediocre ideas that succeeded where brilliant ideas failed, a story of compromises, rushed deadlines and last-minute decisions. And it could so easily have been very, very different.\r\n\r\nWhat if IBM had hired Digital Research instead of Microsoft to develop the operating system for their first PC, way back in 1980? What if Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark had gone to work for Nintendo in 1993 and never founded Netscape? What if one of the team at CERN had said “Tim, won’t it sound a bit silly if everyone spends the next fifty years saying double-you-double-you-double-you all the time”?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Dylan Beattie will explore alternative history of the world wide web - a web with no Microsoft, no Windows; no Firefox, no Google and no JavaScript. A software industry from another timeline, a world of platforms, protocols and programming languages that are unmistakably alien - and yet strangely familiar.\r\n\r\nSo strap in, hold tight, and join us as take you on a journey through... the web that never was.",

Often overlooked in data science discussions are documentation, creation and refresh of data and models, testing, monitoring model performance, and even ensuring data security and compliance.\r\n\r\nIn this session, see how DevOps best practices can be applied to Data Science to meet all these requirements. I'll walk through the practices, and the tools to enable you to get the most out of your Data Science efforts.",

You may have already used languages and libraries that support a functional programming style. But one language stands out as the epitome of functional programming: Haskell. What is it about Haskell that makes it a pure functional programming language? What features does it provide that can help us write quality, maintainable software? How can Haskell give us the confidence to safely refactor and change our software over time?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll take a tour around the Haskell language and see what makes Haskell an all-in functional programming language. We'll look at both Haskell's strengths and its weaknesses. We'll look at what sets coding in Haskell apart from coding in languages like F#, or coding FP-style in languages like JavaScript. We'll also dispel the myth that Haskell is not suitable for \"normal\" software. By the end of the talk, your peek inside Haskell's ivory tower will hopefully entice you to explore its potential further.",

As many have also call it an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), it is unlike the \"narrow\" AI we currently have today which can easily beat us at one specific task but fail to perform a simple task which requires combination of knowledge from multiple domains.\r\n\r\nMost technical explanation in this talk will be done at intuition level to make sure that anyone at any technical level can enjoy and understand.\r\n\r\nI will start with the introduction of what Artificial Intelligence is, followed by a comparison how we solve problem the non-AI vs AI way.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, I will explain how AI can magically solves any problems as long as you can describe your problem mathematically. Next, I will show you two variations of AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning and what are the difference between them.\r\n\r\nI will then continue to explain our current progress in Deep Learning - starting with image recognition which is the most successful use of Deep Learning so far. How we use Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to recognise images which mimics human visual cortex. I will show you a demo of what's the state of the art CNN model can do today and how we express train them with transfer learning and distributed training. CNN is awesome but there are some limitations which soon may be addressed by latest research finding.\r\n\r\nNext, I will tell you the latest trend in generative AI which can mimic human creativity through technique such as Variational Auto-encoder and GAN. I will also show you how we use them to build something like what we only normally see in science fiction movie such as image content reconstruction, mind reading and super resolution.\r\n\r\nIn NLP space, also equally interesting we can make AI understand linguistic with technique like Word embedding. I will show you what we can use it for. Furthermore, by combining it with LSTM we can give ability to AI to even write a poem.\r\n\r\nThen, I will show you why some tasks are so easy for us human to do but not for AI even using the latest state of the art technology. Why it is hard to build an AGI with the lack of better knowledge representation and knowledge transfer across totally different domain. Which is why we need a totally new approach and why we need a centralised/cloud brain model.",

The want their user experience to feel—connected. The world has moved to push and users are waiting for the data-driven experiences we create on the web to catch up.\r\n \r\nGraphQL is Facebook’s response to this challenge and it is quickly proving itself as an attractive alternative to RESTful APIs for a wide range of contexts. GraphQL is a query language that provides a clean and simple syntax for consumers to interrogate your APIs. These queries are strongly typed, hierarchical and enable clients to retrieve only the data they need.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the familiar pull based request-response pattern, GraphQL provides a mechanism for clients to subscribe to real-time updates in the form of Subscriptions. Subscriptions are exciting as they represent the core ability we need to satisfy the connected experience that our users demand. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will take a hands-on look at GraphQL and see how it can be used to build real-time APIs that are a joy to use. Additionally, we will explore how to integrate a React client with GraphQL using the ultra flexible, community driven Apollo client. By the end of the session you will understand what is required to craft a compelling real-time user experience with GraphQL, and have the knowledge to deliver on these requirements.",

This talk discusses software testing, how and when to use Consumer Driven Contract, and how Consumer Driven Contracts can make developers more confident. It also includes live coding to show how to implement Consumer Driven Contracts using the Pact framework.\r\n\r\nTo increase the velocity and reduce the cost of microservices development, it is key to be able to build and deploy new versions with confidence that you don't break any dependencies. Microservices are easy to build and run, but they quickly become a tangled web of dependencies that slow down development and result in broken dependencies. Organisations that transition from a traditional monolithic design to a microservice architecture, will soon realise that it is hard to keep track of all dependencies. Consumer Driven Contracts is a testing paradigm that helps developers keep control on all dependencies in a distributed system and this talk will tell more about how to use it and show how to do so in a live demo.

Through this perspective we have had a unique opporunity to see the entire continuum of testing successes and failures. This has ranged from highly effective teams that can confidently deploy changes multiple times a day through to teams struggling to deploy twice in a year.\r\n\r\nOne of the key things we've observed in the teams that are highly effective is a pragmmatic approach to software testing and a realisation of how to effectively and judiciously use test automation to accelerate delivery speed and confidence. On the other end of the spectrum, we ourselves have written (and seen) everything from heavily mocked, time-consuming implementation tests that impede refactoring, 24 hour long brittle automated UI test suites and 4 week long regression testing cycles (as well as everything in between).\r\n\r\nWe both have a strong passion for code quality, automated testing, DevOps and getting valuable features out quickly and safely to users. This passion, combined with our extensive experience has led to us uncovering and adopting a number of testing techniques and mindsets which we, and teams we have worked with, have found highly effective at reducing overhead of testing while improving confidence and utility.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will blow apart the traditional testing mindset/methodologies and contrast them with the battle-tested pragmatic approaches we've been using. We will also leave attendees with some new, highly effective testing techniques for their toolbelt that are easy to get started with.",

On social media people from a diversity of backgrounds advertise their filtered life on social media and this can cause some negative impacts on their followers, even if they are not aware.\r\n\r\nWe all have problems in life: family, financial, or legal. However posts on social media are often filtered so that the best things are shown. This is my story of how I became a better developer, a better listener, and did more with myself by reducing social media.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe key(board) to workplace happiness - Chris Lewis\r\n\r\nWe all deserve to be happy at work, and happy developers are better developers. Even small things can make a big difference. Have you ever really been “happy” with your keyboard? What if I told you that using the perfect keyboard could make every day that little bit better? I'll tell you my story of how a keyboard obsession helped make me a better developer, and why we don’t need to leave our hobbies at work’s door.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nBack to the future: Taking a history lesson from the Web - Dom Wenden\r\n\r\nWith the rapid pace of change with the web, we often focus on new and spectacular ways to solve a problem when history is most often our best teacher. In this talk I'm going to go through how by looking backwards to embrace some good old fashioned Web 0.0, we ultimately pushed ourselves forward and managed to solve an embarrassing architectural problem at Domain.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nA Top-Down Approach to End-to-End Testing - Martin McDonagh\r\n\r\nOver the years I have talked with many people, from those who have specific testing requirements like web or mobile to those who want that extra little feature that says, “Oh wow, it does that.” I have talked extensively about, heard stories and helped address issues with numerous testing applications. Whether you are doing it or not, end-to-end testing is something we all should be engaging – especially in the day and age of more and more systems becoming integrated. This discussion includes:\r\n\r\nWhat is end-to-end testing?\r\nWho is doing end-to-end testing and why?\r\nCommon mistakes to avoid with end-to-end testing\r\nReal stories from the fire-side\r\n\r\nThe audience leaves the session knowing the benefits of end-to-end testing and learns from others’ mistakes as we become more involved in the bigger picture rather than siloed into functional UI testing or backend API testing. This talk highlights some bumps and corners along the way, but at the end, attendees are on a straighter road to working in a successful testing environment.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nDroning on about drones - Ken Faulkner\r\n\r\nDrones are everywhere; photography, racing, agriculture, surf-life-saving and many other uses. People controlling drones is one thing, computers controlling drones is FAR more fun.\r\n\r\nJoin me while I give a lightning presentation about remote piloting/programming drones for the purposes of good. What you need to get started and \"gotchas\" will be covered.\r\n\r\nThere *may* be a live demo.... (code demos are always fun, a physical demo is just asking for trouble)\r\n\r\nThe will be minimal mention of my plans for Skynet\r\n\r\n>:)",

            "title": "Two platforms, one codebase: Experiences building a cross-platform app with React and React Native",
            "description": "Two years ago I joined a small team at Sportsbet on an ambitious project to re-platform separate web and iOS apps into a single codebase using React and React Native. Furthermore, we had to structure the project so that the team could rapidly grow to 20 developers and beyond. This is the story of why we did it, how we did it, and what we learnt along the way.\r\n\r\nI’ll start with a quick introduction to the app and why it was important to have a unified codebase. I’ll then move onto the different options we investigated for maximising code reuse, and how we settled upon an existing React pattern to give us a simple but highly-scalable solution. I’ll use an example app to demonstrate this pattern in action.\r\n\r\nNext, I’ll move onto how we dealt with the areas where web and native UX naturally diverge, and how we dealt with these differences. I’ll mostly be talking about navigation and routing here, but we’ll also explore animations as well. Again, I’ll aim to demonstrate some of my points with examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll delve into some of the sociological challenges that came up for us on such an ambitious project. This includes how we convinced Objective-C developers to write JavaScript (!), the places where developers commonly tripped-up when adopting React and React Native for the first time, and how we managed a behemoth cross-platform build, testing and deployment process with a rapidly growing team.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave this talk with a better understanding of the strengths (and weaknesses) of cross-platform React codebases, how to structure such a codebase to maximise code reuse whilst still having platform-specific escape hatches available, and what you need to do to keep all of your developers productive as the codebase grows.",

Because of this many operators have adopted the concept of Infrastructure as Code, where you model and create infrastructure using a highly declarative language similar to application code.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will introduce Terraform from HashiCorp, an infrastructure as code tool that allows you to provision IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS across multiple cloud providers.\r\n\r\nWe will explore how Terraform can help you when deploying systems to Azure, and how you can see and approve the changes Terraform will make to your Azure resources.\r\n\r\nWe'll also look at how Terraform can help create reusable and shareable infrastructure code using Modules, and demonstrate how you can access information about existing infrastructure not provisioned by Terraform.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this session, attendees will have an understanding of Terraform's DSL and core workflows; and how Terraform can be used to make changes safely to any infrastructure on any platform.",

There has been a need identified to reduce friction between the operations and development teams. A natural tendency for organizations is to form a DevOps team responsible for these tasks. This can quickly become contrary to the DevOps Movement™. I’ll discuss how my experience of approaching DevOps not as a team effort but instead as a discipline by embedding developers within individual teams who are dedicated to continuously improving the delivery of software. As the quality of software delivery improves these development resources are free to explore enhancing the quality of engineering efforts in roles which have been appropriately coined Site Reliability Engineers. I’ll discuss some of the benefits which happen when DevOps no longer is a team or a position but an organic mechanism that is a reflection of how your organization builds and delivers software.",

Like most \"magic solutions\", they need careful consideration and design. With the promise of guaranteed and predictable throughput, CosmosDb sounds great but what are the factors to consider to ensure that this lofty goal is achieved?  This talk looks at some of the considerations we need to take into account to make CosmosDb work as advertised, at planet scale, and not have a \"planet fail\". We will not only look at the cloud service itself, but also at the client model, specifically at the most popular \"SQL like\" client with specific code examples and how this actually has some of the greatest impact at getting the most out of CosmosDb to achieve world domination.",

You may have already used languages and libraries that support a functional programming style. But one language stands out as the epitome of functional programming: Haskell. What is it about Haskell that makes it a pure functional programming language? What features does it provide that can help us write quality, maintainable software? How can Haskell give us the confidence to safely refactor and change our software over time?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll take a tour around the Haskell language and see what makes Haskell an all-in functional programming language. We'll look at both Haskell's strengths and its weaknesses. We'll look at what sets coding in Haskell apart from coding in languages like F#, or coding FP-style in languages like JavaScript. We'll also dispel the myth that Haskell is not suitable for \"normal\" software. By the end of the talk, your peek inside Haskell's ivory tower will hopefully entice you to explore its potential further.",

The want their user experience to feel—connected. The world has moved to push and users are waiting for the data-driven experiences we create on the web to catch up.\r\n \r\nGraphQL is Facebook’s response to this challenge and it is quickly proving itself as an attractive alternative to RESTful APIs for a wide range of contexts. GraphQL is a query language that provides a clean and simple syntax for consumers to interrogate your APIs. These queries are strongly typed, hierarchical and enable clients to retrieve only the data they need.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the familiar pull based request-response pattern, GraphQL provides a mechanism for clients to subscribe to real-time updates in the form of Subscriptions. Subscriptions are exciting as they represent the core ability we need to satisfy the connected experience that our users demand. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will take a hands-on look at GraphQL and see how it can be used to build real-time APIs that are a joy to use. Additionally, we will explore how to integrate a React client with GraphQL using the ultra flexible, community driven Apollo client. By the end of the session you will understand what is required to craft a compelling real-time user experience with GraphQL, and have the knowledge to deliver on these requirements.",

Each has a queue in front of it. How can we find out which of them are the least efficient? Which ones are slowing us down? Where should we spend time optimizing?\r\n\r\nJoin Mike for a roller-coaster ride through distributed system performance monitoring. Find out which measurements tell you the most about your system and how to optimize it. As an added bonus, you'll learn how to run a successful theme park! Mike has 18 years of experience developing and monitoring complex systems. In that time, he has visited some of the worlds greatest theme parks.",

Little did I know the sheer volume of learning I'd be doing in the future, from basics like cashflow and forecasts to life lessons like always be talking to new people. In this talk I tell the story of how I went from a full time .NET Developer, to a struggling and then mildly successful startup owner. We'll explore how I made the transition from full time employment to self-employment; we'll look at many of the mistakes I've made and how to avoid them; and we'll go through some practical tips to get you started on your own startup journey. My first tip? Learn from other people's experiences!",

              "description": "How close are we to an AI Singularity? As many have also call it an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), it is unlike the \"narrow\" AI we currently have today which can easily beat us at one specific task but fail to perform a simple task which requires combination of knowledge from multiple domains.\r\n\r\nMost technical explanation in this talk will be done at intuition level to make sure that anyone at any technical level can enjoy and understand.\r\n\r\nI will start with the introduction of what Artificial Intelligence is, followed by a comparison how we solve problem the non-AI vs AI way.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, I will explain how AI can magically solves any problems as long as you can describe your problem mathematically. Next, I will show you two variations of AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning and what are the difference between them.\r\n\r\nI will then continue to explain our current progress in Deep Learning - starting with image recognition which is the most successful use of Deep Learning so far. How we use Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to recognise images which mimics human visual cortex. I will show you a demo of what's the state of the art CNN model can do today and how we express train them with transfer learning and distributed training. CNN is awesome but there are some limitations which soon may be addressed by latest research finding.\r\n\r\nNext, I will tell you the latest trend in generative AI which can mimic human creativity through technique such as Variational Auto-encoder and GAN. I will also show you how we use them to build something like what we only normally see in science fiction movie such as image content reconstruction, mind reading and super resolution.\r\n\r\nIn NLP space, also equally interesting we can make AI understand linguistic with technique like Word embedding. I will show you what we can use it for. Furthermore, by combining it with LSTM we can give ability to AI to even write a poem.\r\n\r\nThen, I will show you why some tasks are so easy for us human to do but not for AI even using the latest state of the art technology. Why it is hard to build an AGI with the lack of better knowledge representation and knowledge transfer across totally different domain. Which is why we need a totally new approach and why we need a centralised/cloud brain model.",

              "description": "onsumer Driven Contracts is a testing paradigm that let API-consumers communicate to the API-providers how they are using their services. This talk discusses software testing, how and when to use Consumer Driven Contract, and how Consumer Driven Contracts can make developers more confident. It also includes live coding to show how to implement Consumer Driven Contracts using the Pact framework.\r\n\r\nTo increase the velocity and reduce the cost of microservices development, it is key to be able to build and deploy new versions with confidence that you don't break any dependencies. Microservices are easy to build and run, but they quickly become a tangled web of dependencies that slow down development and result in broken dependencies. Organisations that transition from a traditional monolithic design to a microservice architecture, will soon realise that it is hard to keep track of all dependencies. Consumer Driven Contracts is a testing paradigm that helps developers keep control on all dependencies in a distributed system and this talk will tell more about how to use it and show how to do so in a live demo.

              "description": "Reducing social media helped me become a better developer - Raphael Haddad\r\n\r\nIn a dopamine driven world getting your next 'hit' can be easily done on social media and this can cause you to lose focus. On social media people from a diversity of backgrounds advertise their filtered life on social media and this can cause some negative impacts on their followers, even if they are not aware.\r\n\r\nWe all have problems in life: family, financial, or legal. However posts on social media are often filtered so that the best things are shown. This is my story of how I became a better developer, a better listener, and did more with myself by reducing social media.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe key(board) to workplace happiness - Chris Lewis\r\n\r\nWe all deserve to be happy at work, and happy developers are better developers. Even small things can make a big difference. Have you ever really been “happy” with your keyboard? What if I told you that using the perfect keyboard could make every day that little bit better? I'll tell you my story of how a keyboard obsession helped make me a better developer, and why we don’t need to leave our hobbies at work’s door.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nBack to the future: Taking a history lesson from the Web - Dom Wenden\r\n\r\nWith the rapid pace of change with the web, we often focus on new and spectacular ways to solve a problem when history is most often our best teacher. In this talk I'm going to go through how by looking backwards to embrace some good old fashioned Web 0.0, we ultimately pushed ourselves forward and managed to solve an embarrassing architectural problem at Domain.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nA Top-Down Approach to End-to-End Testing - Martin McDonagh\r\n\r\nOver the years I have talked with many people, from those who have specific testing requirements like web or mobile to those who want that extra little feature that says, “Oh wow, it does that.” I have talked extensively about, heard stories and helped address issues with numerous testing applications. Whether you are doing it or not, end-to-end testing is something we all should be engaging – especially in the day and age of more and more systems becoming integrated. This discussion includes:\r\n\r\nWhat is end-to-end testing?\r\nWho is doing end-to-end testing and why?\r\nCommon mistakes to avoid with end-to-end testing\r\nReal stories from the fire-side\r\n\r\nThe audience leaves the session knowing the benefits of end-to-end testing and learns from others’ mistakes as we become more involved in the bigger picture rather than siloed into functional UI testing or backend API testing. This talk highlights some bumps and corners along the way, but at the end, attendees are on a straighter road to working in a successful testing environment.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nDroning on about drones - Ken Faulkner\r\n\r\nDrones are everywhere; photography, racing, agriculture, surf-life-saving and many other uses. People controlling drones is one thing, computers controlling drones is FAR more fun.\r\n\r\nJoin me while I give a lightning presentation about remote piloting/programming drones for the purposes of good. What you need to get started and \"gotchas\" will be covered.\r\n\r\nThere *may* be a live demo.... (code demos are always fun, a physical demo is just asking for trouble)\r\n\r\nThe will be minimal mention of my plans for Skynet\r\n\r\n>:)",

In this talk we see how we can use Ngrx to get all the benefits of Redux, including using Redux libraries and developer tools. We also see how Ngrx and RXJS mix into Ngrx Effects to provide an experience that works even better than using Redux with React.\r\n\r\nWe also look into the common patterns and best practices to organize your Ngrx code, and make sure it's testable!",

It's a story about information, about breaking down barriers, about creating new ways for people to communicate, to collaborate, and to share their ideas. It’s also a story that has as much do with marketing, money and meetings as it does with research and innovation. It’s a story of mediocre ideas that succeeded where brilliant ideas failed, a story of compromises, rushed deadlines and last-minute decisions. And it could so easily have been very, very different.\r\n\r\nWhat if IBM had hired Digital Research instead of Microsoft to develop the operating system for their first PC, way back in 1980? What if Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark had gone to work for Nintendo in 1993 and never founded Netscape? What if one of the team at CERN had said “Tim, won’t it sound a bit silly if everyone spends the next fifty years saying double-you-double-you-double-you all the time”?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Dylan Beattie will explore alternative history of the world wide web - a web with no Microsoft, no Windows; no Firefox, no Google and no JavaScript. A software industry from another timeline, a world of platforms, protocols and programming languages that are unmistakably alien - and yet strangely familiar.\r\n\r\nSo strap in, hold tight, and join us as take you on a journey through... the web that never was.",

There has been a need identified to reduce friction between the operations and development teams. A natural tendency for organizations is to form a DevOps team responsible for these tasks. This can quickly become contrary to the DevOps Movement™. I’ll discuss how my experience of approaching DevOps not as a team effort but instead as a discipline by embedding developers within individual teams who are dedicated to continuously improving the delivery of software. As the quality of software delivery improves these development resources are free to explore enhancing the quality of engineering efforts in roles which have been appropriately coined Site Reliability Engineers. I’ll discuss some of the benefits which happen when DevOps no longer is a team or a position but an organic mechanism that is a reflection of how your organization builds and delivers software.",

After learning about portable class libraries in the past years, it is now time to upgrade our game and start coding for Linux, Mac OS and other platforms untouched by .NET until now. More and more libraries are getting ported to .NET Standard, sometimes really easily and sometimes more painfully. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, the creator of the popular open source MVVM Light Toolkit, will help you understand why .NET Standard can benefit you, and talk about his experiences converting his framework to .NET Standard.",

Microsoft's CosmosDb advertises itself as a \"planet scale data storage solution\" that can facilitate such scalability, but how is such magic achieved? Like most \"magic solutions\", they need careful consideration and design. With the promise of guaranteed and predictable throughput, CosmosDb sounds great but what are the factors to consider to ensure that this lofty goal is achieved?  This talk looks at some of the considerations we need to take into account to make CosmosDb work as advertised, at planet scale, and not have a \"planet fail\". We will not only look at the cloud service itself, but also at the client model, specifically at the most popular \"SQL like\" client with specific code examples and how this actually has some of the greatest impact at getting the most out of CosmosDb to achieve world domination.",

              "description": "Software testing is undeniably hard. Rob and Graeme have worked with many teams over many years through consulting with a wide range of companies. Through this perspective we have had a unique opporunity to see the entire continuum of testing successes and failures. This has ranged from highly effective teams that can confidently deploy changes multiple times a day through to teams struggling to deploy twice in a year.\r\n\r\nOne of the key things we've observed in the teams that are highly effective is a pragmmatic approach to software testing and a realisation of how to effectively and judiciously use test automation to accelerate delivery speed and confidence. On the other end of the spectrum, we ourselves have written (and seen) everything from heavily mocked, time-consuming implementation tests that impede refactoring, 24 hour long brittle automated UI test suites and 4 week long regression testing cycles (as well as everything in between).\r\n\r\nWe both have a strong passion for code quality, automated testing, DevOps and getting valuable features out quickly and safely to users. This passion, combined with our extensive experience has led to us uncovering and adopting a number of testing techniques and mindsets which we, and teams we have worked with, have found highly effective at reducing overhead of testing while improving confidence and utility.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will blow apart the traditional testing mindset/methodologies and contrast them with the battle-tested pragmatic approaches we've been using. We will also leave attendees with some new, highly effective testing techniques for their toolbelt that are easy to get started with.",

              "description": "Two years ago I joined a small team at Sportsbet on an ambitious project to re-platform separate web and iOS apps into a single codebase using React and React Native. Furthermore, we had to structure the project so that the team could rapidly grow to 20 developers and beyond. This is the story of why we did it, how we did it, and what we learnt along the way.\r\n\r\nI’ll start with a quick introduction to the app and why it was important to have a unified codebase. I’ll then move onto the different options we investigated for maximising code reuse, and how we settled upon an existing React pattern to give us a simple but highly-scalable solution. I’ll use an example app to demonstrate this pattern in action.\r\n\r\nNext, I’ll move onto how we dealt with the areas where web and native UX naturally diverge, and how we dealt with these differences. I’ll mostly be talking about navigation and routing here, but we’ll also explore animations as well. Again, I’ll aim to demonstrate some of my points with examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll delve into some of the sociological challenges that came up for us on such an ambitious project. This includes how we convinced Objective-C developers to write JavaScript (!), the places where developers commonly tripped-up when adopting React and React Native for the first time, and how we managed a behemoth cross-platform build, testing and deployment process with a rapidly growing team.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave this talk with a better understanding of the strengths (and weaknesses) of cross-platform React codebases, how to structure such a codebase to maximise code reuse whilst still having platform-specific escape hatches available, and what you need to do to keep all of your developers productive as the codebase grows.",
